# Basic compton config with fade transition and shadows

# Drop shadows
# If you use this config with i3-gaps, compton will draw shadows on title bars. This is because 
# i3 creates title bars as windows. I've only been able to circumvent this by removing title bars 
# completely - see my i3 config files.
shadow = true;			            # Enabled client-side shadows on windows
shadow-radius = 10;		          # The blur radius for shadows (default 12)

shadow-offset-y = -10;		        # The top offset for shadows (default -15)

# Fading transitions
fading = true; 			            # Fade windows during opacity changes
fade-delta = 5; 		            # The time between steps in a fade in milliseconds (default 10)
